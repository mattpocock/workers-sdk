### Minor Changes

- [#4324](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4324) [`16cc2e92`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/16cc2e923733b3c583b5bf6c40384c52fea04991) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - Update to [latest `workerd@1.20231030.0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/releases/tag/v1.20231030.0)

* [#4322](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4322) [`8a25b7fb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/8a25b7fba94c8e9989412bc266ada307975f182d) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - add `unsafeEvalBinding` option

  Add option to leverage the newly introduced [`UnsafeEval`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/1338) workerd binding API,
  such API is used to evaluate javascript code at runtime via the provided `eval` and `newFunction` methods.

  The API, for security reasons (as per the [workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-standards/#javascript-standards)), is not to be use in production but it is intended for local purposes only such as local testing.

  To use the binding you need to specify a string value for the `unsafeEvalBinding`, such will be the name of the `UnsafeEval` bindings that will be made available in the workerd runtime.

  For example the following code shows how to set the binding with the `UNSAFE_EVAL` name and evaluate the `1+1` string:

  ```ts
  const mf = new Miniflare({
  	log,
  	modules: true,
  	script: `
        export default {
            fetch(req, env, ctx) {
                const two = env.UNSAFE_EVAL.eval('1+1');
                return new Response('two = ' + two); // returns 'two = 2'
            }
        }
    `,
  	unsafeEvalBinding: "UNSAFE_EVAL",
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [#4321](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4321) [`29a59d4e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/29a59d4e72e3ae849474325c5c93252a3f84af0d) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: ensure `Mutex` doesn't report itself as drained if locked

  Previously, Miniflare's `Mutex` implementation would report itself as drained
  if there were no waiters, regardless of the locked state. This bug meant that
  if you called but didn't `await` `Miniflare#setOptions()`, future calls to
  `Miniflare#dispatchFetch()` (or any other asynchronous `Miniflare` method)
  wouldn't wait for the options update to apply and the runtime to restart before
  sending requests. This change ensures we wait until the mutex is unlocked before
  reporting it as drained.
